### Job Skills Learned

- Create an Azure Resource Manager template.
- Edit an Azure Resource Manager template and redeploy the template.
- Configure the Cloud Shell and deploy a template with Azure PowerShell.
- Deploy a template with the CLI.
- Deploy a resource by using Azure Bicep.


### Tools Used

- Azure portal - https://portal.azure.com
- Cloud Shell
- Azure PowerShell
- CLI


## Steps

## Task 1: Create an Azure Resource Manager template
In this task, we will create a managed disk in the Azure portal. Managed disks are storage designed to be used with virtual machines. Once the disk is deployed you will export a template that you can use in other deployments.
1.	Sign in to the Azure portal - https://portal.azure.com.
2.	Search for and select Disks.
3.	On the Disks page, select Create.
4.	On the Create a managed disk page, configure the disk and then select Ok.

We are creating a simple managed disk so you can practice with templates. Azure managed disks are block-level storage volumes that are managed by Azure.

5.	Click Review + Create then select Create.
6.	Monitor the notifications (upper right) and after the deployment select Go to resource.

7.	In the Automation blade, select Export template.
8.	Take a minute to review the Template and Parameters files.

9.	Click Download and save the templates to the local drive. This creates a compressed zipped file.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6500bc9-5d4a-4e98-9657-65186de9e2d7)
 
10.	Use File Explorer to extract the content of the downloaded file into the Downloads folder on your computer. Notice there are two JSON files (template and parameters).

## Task 2: Edit an Azure Resource Manager template and then redeploy the template

In this task, you use the downloaded template to deploy a new managed disk. This task outlines how to quicky and easily repeat deployments.

1.	In the Azure portal, search for and select Deploy a custom template.
2.	On the Custom deployment blade, notice there is the ability to use a Quickstart template. There are many built-in templates as shown in the drop-down menu.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d9b330c-9ad5-4c22-aa6d-c3d0234e34f0)
 
3.	Instead of using a Quickstart, select Build your own template in the editor.
4.	On the Edit template blade, click Load file and upload the template.json file you downloaded to the local disk.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/182e0414-52b1-48d2-a45a-4c4343237071)
 
5.	Within the editor pane, make these changes.
o	Change disks_az104_disk1_name to disk_name (two places to change)
o	Change az104-disk1 to az104-disk2 (one place to change)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d125820-9f76-4898-a170-d54d6d25aec2)
 
6.	Notice this is a Standard disk. The location is eastus. The disk size is 32GB.
7.	Save your changes.
8.	Donâ€™t forget the parameters file. Select Edit parameters, click Load file and upload the parameters.json.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d83c886-f286-4893-874e-84641d6be6ed)
 
9.	Make this change so it matches the template file.
Change disks_az104_disk1_name to disk_name (one place to change)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/276c1591-3541-4584-b913-e9fdae83fcda)
 
10.	Save your changes.
11.	Complete the custom deployment settings:

## Task 3: Configure the Cloud Shell and deploy a template with PowerShell

In this task, you work with the Azure Cloud Shell and Azure PowerShell. Azure Cloud Shell is an interactive, authenticated, browser-accessible terminal for managing Azure resources. It provides the flexibility of choosing the shell experience that best suits the way you work, either Bash or PowerShell. In this task, you use PowerShell to deploy a template.

1.	Select the Cloud Shell icon in the top right of the Azure Portal. Alternately, you can navigate directly to https://shell.azure.com.
2.	When prompted to select either Bash or PowerShell, select PowerShell.
